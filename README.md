## Configuring

VS Code specific settings are available from `⌘ + Shift + P`, then typing `wakatime`.

For example, to hide today's coding activity in your status bar:

Press `⌘ + Shift + P` then set `Hackatime: Status Bar Coding Activity` to `false`.

### Status Bar Alignment

You can customize the position and priority of the Hackatime status bar item:

- **Alignment**: Set `wakatime.align` to `left` or `right` to control which side of the status bar shows the Hackatime item
- **Priority**: Set `wakatime.alignPriority` to a number to control the order (higher values appear more to the left)

Both settings require restarting VS Code to take effect.

Extension settings are stored in the INI file at `$HOME/.wakatime.cfg`.

More information can be found from [wakatime-cli][wakatime-cli configs].

If using an online IDE like [gitpods](https://gitpod.io/), add your [api key][api key] to global ENV key `WAKATIME_API_KEY`.

Notes:

1. `$HOME` defaults to `$HOME`
1. To disable the extension at startup add `disabled=true` to your config, this operation can also be performed by pressing `⌘ + Shift + P` and selecting `Hackatime: Disable`.

## Troubleshooting

First, turn on debug mode:

1. Press `F1` or `⌘ + Shift + P`
2. Type `> Hackatime: Debug`, and press `Enter`.
3. Select `true`, then press `Enter`.

Next, open your Developer Console to view logs and errors:

`Help → Toggle Developer Tools`

Errors outside the scope of vscode-wakatime go to `$HOME/.wakatime/wakatime.log` from [wakatime-cli][wakatime-cli help].

If your error message contains "won't send heartbeat due to backoff" then delete your `~/.wakatime/wakatime-internal.cfg` file to trigger an API connection so we can see the real error message.

The [How to Debug Plugins][how to debug] guide shows how to check when coding activity was last received from your editor using the [Plugins Status Page][plugins status page].

**Microsoft Windows Only:** Using Hackatime behind a corporate proxy? Try enabling your Windows Root Certs inside VS Code with the [win-ca][winca] extension:
Press `Ctrl + Shift + X`, search for `win-ca`, press `Install`.

For more general troubleshooting info, see the [wakatime-cli Troubleshooting Section][wakatime-cli help].

### SSH configuration

If you're connected to a remote host using the [ssh extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) you might want to force Hackatime to run locally instead on the server. This configuration is needed when the server you connect is shared among other people. Please follow [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_advanced-forcing-an-extension-to-run-locally-remotely) guide.

## Uninstalling

1. Click the Extensions sidebar item in VS Code.

2. Type `hackatime` and hit enter.

3. Click the settings icon next to Hackatime, then click Uninstall.

4. Delete the `~/.wakatime*` files in your home directory, unless you’re still using Hackatime with another IDE.
